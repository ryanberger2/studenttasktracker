# StudentTaskTracker

## Background 
Treba Hollowell is an elementary school teacher in Billings, MT. She's currently teaching 1st grade. But the problem she wants to solve applies to many grades. From the beginning of the year, she assigns each student a number (1 - 16). The number comes in handy for recognizing their cubbies, their desks, any work or projects they've done (not all first graders can read eachothers' names). When students are tasked to do work during class, whether individually or in groups, some students are good about remaining on-task, but others aren't. Verbal reminders to stay on task don't always work. The way Mrs. Hollowell currently tries to solve this is with a large "clip up clipboard." The clipboard displays all students' numbers so they can be seen from anywhere in the classroom. She'll put a clothespin next to students' numbers who are on task and take them down when they're not. But she has to physically go back to the clipboard whenever she wants to make a change, and it doesn't grab students' attention. Also, there's no real consequence for students who are on task or aren't. And if the teacher wants to keep track of longer behavior patterns, they would have to do a lot of manual work.

## Problems to solve 
1. Support a large display that will show students who is on task and who is not in real-time. (My mom suggested having their number "light up" because she often uses lighting to direct students' attention. Assumed the classroom has an easy way to project the contents of a webpage for students to see.)
2. Make it easy for the teacher to toggle "on" the students who are on task and "off" for students who are not on task with her laptop at her desk, a tablet, or a smart phone, so they can make changes in realtime, can make changes from anywhere, and don't have to turn their back on the students.
3. Make it easy for the teacher to "reset" the entire classroom to be on-task all at once.
4. Make it easy for the teacher to enable or disable "track students", which will start or end a 'recording session' for their on-task or off-task time.
5. Make it easy for the teacher to assign a unique number to each student. (Nice to have: Allow the teacher to modify the number assignments).
6. Nice to have: Show students when recording is in progress, and the length of time recording has been enabled.
